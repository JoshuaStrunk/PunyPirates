Puny Pirates!
============
So our final results is a game called Puny Pirates! It is a 1v1, arcade fighting game. It uses twin sticks for movement and shooting cannonballs at each other. The overall objective is to throw your opponenent into the water and force them down to Davy Jones locker. 

To Play
===========
Currently only support Windows.
You can get all of are alpha builds here TAMUGameJam1/GameJam1Unity/Builds/ 

If you want an individual build you will need the builds data folder and its exe. Currently our builds only support play with two connected Xbox controllers connected as player 1 and player 2. We have not tested outher gamepads and currently consider them not supported. 

To Build
=========
We developed Puny Pirates! using Unity 4.5x on Windows 7. So if you pull our source you should be able to build the project folder TAMUGameJam1/GameJam1Unity/ in Unity 4.5xTAMUGameJam1 / GameJam1Unity
