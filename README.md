Puny Pirates!
============
Game created during Texas A&amp;M University Game Jam on November 7-9, 2014

Puny Pirates is a 1v1, arcade fighting game. It uses twin sticks for movement and shooting cannonballs at each other. The overall objective is to throw your opponenent into the water and force them down to Davy Jones' locker. 

To Play
===========
Currently Puny Pirates! only supports Windows and has only been tested playing with 2 Xbox controllers. There is some preliminary keyboard support, but you need to build it yourself to set it up.

You can get all of our alpha builds here https://github.com/JoshuaStrunk/TAMUGameJam1/tree/master/GameJam1Unity/Builds

If you want an individual build you will need the builds data folder and its exe. Currently our builds only support play with two connected Xbox controllers connected as player 1 and player 2. We have not tested other gamepads and currently consider them not supported. 

To Build
=========
We developed Puny Pirates! using Unity 4.5x on Windows 7. So if you pull our source you should be able to build the project folder https://github.com/JoshuaStrunk/TAMUGameJam1/tree/master/GameJam1Unity in Unity 4.5x
